const gulp = require('gulp');
const core = require('./bower_components/core/gulp_helper');
const pkg = require('./package.json');

//You should pass options to the createTasks method below
let options = {
  pkg, //pass in the contents of package.json

  //How this app should be embedded in the simulator. Options are: 'full', 'left', or 'right'
  //This is optional, and the default value is 'full'
  embedArea: 'full',

  //If you want to add vars to the preprocessor context, include this option
  //You can add environment-specific vars or general vars
  preprocessorContext: {
    local: {
      SOME_ENV: 'SOME_ENV will have this value in the local build environment'
    },
    dev: {
      SOME_ENV: 'SOME_ENV will have this value in the dev build environment'
    },
    qa: {
      SOME_ENV: 'SOME_ENV will have this value in the qa build environment'
    },
    prod: {
      SOME_ENV: 'SOME_ENV will have this value in the prod build environment'
    },
    SOME_OTHER_ENV: 'this var will be in the context of any environment'
  },

  //If you want to override the environment that the build process uses, specify it here
  //Valid values are: 'local', 'dev', 'qa', 'prod'
  //If you omit this (which you probably should), then the environment will be:
  //'local' when running or building on your machine
  //'dev' when calling gulp deploy:dev
  //'qa' when calling gulp deploy:qa
  //'prod' when calling gulp deploy:prod
  environmentOverride: null
};

//This creates several gulp tasks to use during development:
//default, clean, build, build_with_simulator, run, deploy:dev, deploy:qa, deploy:prod
core.embeddedApp.createTasks(gulp, options);


//Note that you can override any task that createTasks added, by redefining it after the call to createTasks
//ex:
// gulp.task('deploy:dev', ['_deploy_prep'], () => {
//   ...do some custom deploy code...
// });

//FAKING DATA AND CONFIG FILES:
//Some apps will load data and configurations from 'data' files, usually JSON.
//The location of these files in Dev, QA, and Prod may vary:
//- Could be in the S3 data bucket
//- Could be in a custom Wordpress post
//To 'fake' this when running your app locally, do the following:
// 1. Put some sample data/config files into /src/data folder in the project
// 2. Overwrite the _data gulp task here to copy your data files into a file path that mimics the one on your web server:
// gulp.task('_data', () => {
//   let myDataPath = '/data'; //On S3, this will be something like /data/division/my_app
//                             //On WP, this will be something different
//   return gulp.src(['src/data/**/*']).pipe(gulp.dest('dist' + myDataPath));
// });
